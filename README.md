# gptj-bot

You will need node and typescript.
You also need to copy `example.env` file to a file simply called `.env`. You should edit `.env` by replacing the placeholder values (`12345678910`) with your pipeline id, cloud pipeline api token, and discord bot token.

From within the gptj-bot directory...

- use `npm install` to install the node packages.
- use `tsc` to build the project.
- use `node .` to run the bot.
